7.1 Inexact Newton Methods
=====================================

Recall that the basic Newton step :math:`p_k^N` is obtained by solving the symmetric :math:`n \times n` linear system

.. math::
   :label: eq7-1

   \nabla^2 f_kp_k^N = - \nabla f_k

In this section, we describe techniques for obtaining approximations to :math:`p_k^N` that are inexpensive to calculate but are good search directions or steps. These approaches are based on solving :eq:`eq7-1` by using the conjugate gradient method or the Lanczos method. We refer to this family of methods by the general name **inexact Newton methods**.

Local Convergence of Inexact Newton Methods
-------------------------------------

Most rules for terminating the iterative solver :eq:`eq7-1` are based on the residual

.. math::

   r_k = \nabla^2 f_kp_k + \nabla f_k

where :math:`p_k` is the inexact Newton step. Usually we terminate the CG iterations when

.. math::

   \lVert r_k \rVert \leq \eta_k \lVert \nabla f_k \rVert

where the sequence :math:`\{\eta_k\}` with :math:`0 < \eta_k < 1` is called the **forcing sequence**.

**Theorem 7.1.** Suppose that :math:`\nabla^2 f(x)` exists and is continuous in a neighborhood of a minimizer :math:`x^*`, with :math:`\nabla^2 f(x^*)` is positive definite. Consider the iteration :math:`x_{k+1} = x_k + p_k` where :math:`p_k` satisfies :math:`\lVert r_k \rVert \leq \eta_k \lVert \nabla f_k \rVert`, and assume that :math:`\eta_k \leq \eta` for some constant :math:`\eta \in [0, 1)`. Then if the starting point :math:`x_0` is sufficiently near :math:`x^*`, the sequence :math:`\{x_k\}` converges to :math:`x^*` and satisfies

.. math::

   \lVert \nabla^2 f(x^*)(x_{k+1}-x^*)\rVert \leq \hat{\eta}\lVert\nabla^2 f(x^*)(x_k - x^*)\rVert

for some constant :math:`\hat{\eta}` with :math:`\eta < \hat{\eta} < 1`.

**Theorem 7.2.** Suppose that the conditions of Theorem 7.1 hold, and assume that the iterates :math:`\{x_k\}` generated by the inexact Newton method converge to :math:`x^*`. Then the rate of convergence is superlinear if :math:`\eta_k \to 0`. If in addition, :math:`\nabla^2 f(x)` is Lipschitz continous for :math:`x` near :math:`x^*` and if :math:`\eta_k = O(\lVert \nabla f_k \rVert)`, then the convergence is quadratic.
